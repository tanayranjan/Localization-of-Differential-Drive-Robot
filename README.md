# Localization-of-Differential-Drive-Robot

## Description

In this project, we performed localization of Differential Drive Robot, using 2 given landmarks.
The Robot has Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) attached with a Servo Motor (MG995) which is used to get position of landmarks with respect to the Robot's Position

The program calculates the position of the robot by applying triangulation, given the distance of both landmarks w.r.t. the robot, and distance between 2 landmark given initially

It updates both position of robot, and distance between landmarks regurlarly
